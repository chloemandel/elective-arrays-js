We're going to use test driven development (TDD) to write a set of functions that will help us organize and choose our electives for the school year. Go ahead and open your text editor to get started on this lab. The file where you will write your code is called `arrays.js`.

Live preview your index.html page in your browser to see your tests.

Here is the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) on arrays if you need some help. 

You're also going to need to use `iteration` for some of the answers. There are many different JavaScript functions that act out iteration. Feel free to use a for loop or try working with some other useful built in Javascript functions. 

Here is an example of how to use a for loop:
```js
var candies = ["snickers", "milkyway", "reeses"]

for(var i=0; i < candies.length; i++) {
  console.log(`I love ${candies[i]} so much`)
}
```
