// This year's elective choices are photography, ceramics, music, robotics, web development, and an independent study. We've created an array called 'electives' for you to use to test your functions out.
var electives = ["photography", "ceramics", "music", "robotics", "web development", "independent study"]

// Code your solutions

// 1: Create a function called countItems that takes an array as an argument and RETURNS (don't use console.log) the number of items in the array. Take a look through the Javascript documentation to see if there is an array function built in to Javascript that can help you count the items. 
function countItems(array) {

}

// 2: Create a function called firstItem that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item in the array.



// 3: Create a function called lastItem that takes an array as an argument and returns the last item in the array. 



// 4: Create a function called alphabeticalFirst that takes an array as an argument and returns the first item from an array when it is sorted in alphabetical order. 



// 5: Create a function called randomItem that will return a random item from an array that is given as an argument.



// 6: After mulling over these elective options, you've decided you don't want to take an independent study anymore. Write a function called removeItem that removes the last item in the array and then logs out the array to the screen.



// 7: You've decided to add debate club to your elective options.Write a function called addItem that adds an item onto the array and then logs out the array to the screen. This function will need to take in two arguments: the array and the item that you want to add to the array.



// 8: Create a function called printItems that uses console.log to print out a numbered list of each item in the array. Like this: 
//  1. photography
//  2. ceramics
//  etc....



// 9: Create a function called reverseEach that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns another array where the strings have each been reversed.



//  Bonus Items: Your school has decided that before you can take an elective you have to pass some tests to make sure sure you're not a robot!

// 10: Create a function called sum that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all of the numbers in the array.



// 11: Create a function called average that takes an array as an argument and returns the mean of all of the numbers in the array.



// 12: Double Bonus! Write a function called lengthFinder that takes in an array of strings and returns an array containing the length of each of those strings.
